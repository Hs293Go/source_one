# SolidWorks modelling for TBS Source One

## Motivation
The chief motivation is to create a solid model for the TBS Source One. A solid model opens up possibilities for further analysis, such as FEA for aerodynamic or aero-structure analysis.

The original intention for this project is to create an .stl file, such that the model can be imported into Gazebo simulation, i.e. via the use of an .sdf file. This is an ongoing private project, with the goal of bringing the PX4 flight stack into drone racing.

## SolidWorks
SolidWorks is a fairly common and basic solid modelling software. It is general purpose and widely available in a college/research context. 

## To do list
* Fully dimension sketches by cross-referencing Fusion360 and SW models
* Get standardized bolt sizes and lengths
* Get press-nut part file
* Implement global variables based on Fusion360 usage
* Save model in Parasolid, IGES, and STEP
