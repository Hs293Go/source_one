# SolidWorks modelling for TBS Source One

## Motivation
The chief motivation is to create a solid model for the TBS Source One. A solid model opens up possibilities for further analysis, such as FEA for aerodynamic or aero-structure analysis.

The original intention for this project is to create an .stl file, such that the model can be imported into Gazebo simulation, i.e. via the use of an .sdf file. This is an ongoing private project, with the goal of bringing the PX4 flight stack into drone racing.

## SolidWorks
SolidWorks is a fairly common and basic solid modelling software. It is general purpose and widely available in a college/research context. However, it has limited support for collaboration and its versioning is abysmal. Moving to other software, such as Solid Edge or Siemens NX, is being explored.

## Standards and principles
TBD
